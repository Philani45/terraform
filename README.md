 Key Configuration Details

 main.tf
This file contains the resource blocks for creating:

- Null EC2 Instances: A placeholder for instances to demonstrate configurations.
- Security Groups: Custom rules for ingress and egress traffic.
- VPCs: Custom VPC setup with subnets.
- Other Resources: Includes IAM roles, key pairs, etc., if applicable.

variables.tf
Define the variables for:

- Region (e.g., `us-east-1`)
- VPC CIDR blocks
- Instance types
- Security group rules

 terraform.tfvars
This file holds the values for variables, such as:

```hcl
region       = "us-east-1"
vpc_cidr     = "10.0.0.0/16"
instance_type = "t2.micro"
```

*Ensure this file is added to `.gitignore` to avoid exposing sensitive information.*

 outputs.tf
Define outputs to display key resource information, such as:

- VPC ID
- EC2 instance public IP

Notes

- Cost Management: Make sure to monitor AWS usage to avoid unexpected costs.
- Cleanup: Destroy the infrastructure after use to avoid unnecessary charges:


$ terraform destroy
